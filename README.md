# trRouting
Transit routing server app written in C++ using the Connection Scan Algorithm including flexible parameters.

## Performance
With random origin and destination (multiple accessible stops at origin and destination): ~150 ms for access and egress footpaths calculation, ~8 ms for CSA two-way calculation (tested with montreal area GTFS data including all urban and suburban transit agencies, with transfer footpaths between stops of 10 minutes walking or less) on a MacPro 2013 with single thread used (you can start multiple servers and execute parallel requests).

## Dependencies
[Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)][3] (an osrm server with a walking profile must be running for the transit region while making queries to the trRouting server, see [OSRM profiles][5] for more profile info and [Running OSRM][6] to know how to prepare osm data for OSRM and start the server)

## Mac OS X Install with homebrew
```
brew install boost
brew install capnp
brew install spdlog
brew install nlohmann-json
```

## Ubuntu 16.04 Install

[Install Cap'nProto](https://capnproto.org/install.html)
```
sudo apt-get install clang libboost-all-dev libexpat1-dev libjsoncpp-dev libspdlog-dev nlohmann-json3-dev
```

## Compilation
trRouting use autoconf/automake as its build system. A recap of the usual commands: 

If you are running out of a git checkout: 
```
autoreconf -i
```

Then: 
```
./configure
make
```

On ARM mac with boost installed by homebrew:
```
CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/homebrew/include/ ./configure --with-boost-libdir="/opt/homebrew/lib/"
make
```

## Test

trRouting uses [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) to unit test the application. To run the tests, you must first fetch the googletest submodule once into the repo:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, to run the unit tests individually, simply run `make check`.

If you get the following error when running `make check`, that's because the submodule initiation and update was done after the compilation configuration. Simply run again `autoreconf -i && ./configure` and it should work.

```
Makefile:443: ../googletest/googletest/src/.deps/libgtest_la-gtest-all.Plo: No such file or directory
make[1]: *** No rule to make target '../googletest/googletest/src/.deps/libgtest_la-gtest-all.Plo'.  Stop.
```

### Benchmarks

This repo also contains benchmarks to run various calculations. The benchmarks are under the `tests/` along, with the unit tests. To automatically run them with the `make check` command, configure the repo by running `./configure --enable-benchmark`. Otherwise, benchmarks can be executed manually by running the executable in the benchmark directory.

See the README in the benchmark's directory for additional instructions to run them.
