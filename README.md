Transit routing server app written in C++ using the Connection Scan Algorithm including flexible parameters.

## Performance
With random origin and destination (multiple accessible stops at origin and destination): ~150 ms for access and egress footpaths calculation, ~8 ms for CSA two-way calculation (tested with montreal area GTFS data including all urban and suburban transit agencies, with transfer footpaths between stops of 10 minutes walking or less) on a MacPro 2013 with single thread used (you can start multiple servers and execute parallel requests).

## Dependencies
[Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)][3] (must be installed separately, see [install and usage instructions in OSRM Wiki][4])
use -DBOOST_ROOT option to choose boost path if not default (ex: /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib)
